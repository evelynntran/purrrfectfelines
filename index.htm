            Kitten - Birth to 6 Months <br />
            During this early developmental stage, kittens are full of energy
            and learning to navigate the world. These six months are crucial, as
            kittens experience the most life-determining changes! This is the
            stage where their personality begins to emerge and truly shine.
            Providing proper socialization and care during this time helps set
            the foundation for a happy, confident adult cat.

          <div class="grid-item">
            Junior - 1-2 Years Old <br />
            This playful stage of life means having an extremely active feline
            friend. Cats in this life stage are considered adolescents and
            require just as much enrichment and attention as kittens. Their
            energy levels remain high, and they are still learning important
            social and behavioral skills. Providing consistent interaction and
            stimulating activities will help them develop into well-adjusted
            adult cats.
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            Adult - 3-6 Years Old <br />
            These years are prime for cats, as they are considered in their
            prime. During this stage, cats are typically at their healthiest and
            most active, striking a balance between playful energy and maturity.
            They have settled into their personalities, making it a great time
            to deepen your bond with them. Regular health check-ups, a balanced
            diet, and mental stimulation are essential to ensure they remain
            happy and healthy. This is also a good time to establish consistent
            routines to keep your feline friend thriving. <br />
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            Mature - 7-10 Years Old <br />
            During this stage, naps under the sun slowly start replacing playful
            activity. Don’t worry; your cat still enjoys interaction, but they
            may prefer calmer, more relaxed activities. It’s important to
            monitor their health closely, as age-related changes may begin to
            appear. Providing a comfortable and stress-free environment helps
            them adapt to their slowing pace. Regular vet check-ups, a healthy
            diet tailored to their age, and gentle exercise will ensure they
            stay happy and content during these golden years. Cherish these
            moments as your cat becomes an even more affectionate companion.

            Senior - 11-14 Years Old <br />
            As cats enter this senior stage, they really begin slowing down.
            It’s common for their senses, such as vision or hearing, to decline,
            so they may need extra care and attention. Regular veterinary
            check-ups are crucial to catch and manage any age-related health
            issues like arthritis or kidney disease. Providing a comfortable and
            accessible environment with gentle bedding and easily reachable
            resources helps them stay at ease. Despite their age, senior cats
            can still enjoy gentle play and affection, making this stage of life
            deeply rewarding for both the cat and their owner. <br />

          <div class="grid-item">
            Geriatric - 15+ Years Old <br />
            In the geriatric stage, cats require extra care and attention as
            their bodies and senses age further. They may experience significant
            changes, such as reduced mobility, increased sleep, or difficulty
            with activities they once enjoyed. Regular veterinary visits are
            essential to manage chronic conditions like arthritis, kidney
            disease, or cognitive decline. Providing a quiet and safe
            environment, with easily accessible food, water, and litter boxes,
            helps reduce stress and supports their comfort. Despite their age,
            geriatric cats can still enjoy love, gentle interactions, and the
            companionship of their humans, making their golden years special and
            cherished. <br />
