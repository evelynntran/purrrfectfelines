    <h> Abnormal Behaviors </h> <br />
    <br />
    <h> Aggression </h> <br />
    <p>
      Aggressive behavior, such as biting, scratching, or hissing, can result
      from fear, territorial disputes, or pain. Cats may also become aggressive
      if they feel cornered or threatened, or due to changes in their
      environment.
    </p>
    <h> Overgrooming</h> <br />
    <p>
      Excessive licking of fur can be caused by stress, allergies, or skin
      infections. It may also be a sign of pain or discomfort, leading the cat
      to lick the area repeatedly in an attempt to soothe itself.
    </p>
    <h> Diet Changes </h>
    <p>
      A sudden increase or decrease in appetite can be a sign of health problems
      like gastrointestinal issues, dental pain, or thyroid disease. A change in
      eating habits should be monitored closely and addressed with a vet if it
      persists.

      <h> Purring </h> <br />
      <p>
        Purring is a common behavior in cats that often signifies contentment,
        comfort, or relaxation. Cats typically purr when being petted, cuddled,
        or when they’re in a familiar, safe environment, but it can also occur
        when they are anxious or in pain, as a self-soothing mechanism.
      </p>
      <h> Chattering </h> <br />
      <p>
        Chattering is a behavior where cats make short, rapid vocalizations,
        often while watching birds or small prey animals. This may indicate
        excitement, frustration, or the cat’s natural hunting instincts at work,
        as they mimic the sounds of their prey or prepare to pounce.
      </p>
      <h> Scratching </h> <br />
      <p>
        Scratching is a natural instinct for cats, used for marking territory,
        stretching muscles, and sharpening their claws. Cats scratch surfaces to
        leave scent markers from glands in their paws and to keep their claws
        healthy, preventing overgrowth.
      </p>
      <h> Grooming</h> <br />
      <p>
        Grooming is a self-care behavior in cats where they lick their fur to
        clean themselves. This not only helps maintain their coat but also
        provides comfort and stress relief, as it releases endorphins and
        ensures they stay clean and free of parasites.
      </p>
      <h> Kneading </h> <br />
      <p>
        Kneading is a behavior where cats press their paws alternately against a
        soft surface, often purring while doing so. This action originates from
        kittenhood, when they kneaded their mother’s belly to stimulate milk
        flow, and it signifies comfort, affection, or contentment in adult cats.
      </p>
      <h> Tail Wagging</h> <br />
      <p>
        A cat's tail wagging is often a sign of frustration, irritation, or
        excitement. Unlike dogs, a wagging tail in cats usually indicates they
        are feeling agitated or overstimulated, and the speed or direction of
        the wag can give more insight into their mood.
      </p>
      <h> Zoomies </h> <br />
      <p>
        Zoomies refer to sudden bursts of energy where cats run around rapidly,
        often in circles or up and down furniture. This behavior is typically a
        way for cats to release pent-up energy, and it’s common after eating,
        using the litter box, or during playtime.
